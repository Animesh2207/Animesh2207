## ✨ Want this README customized?
I’ve created a polished, ready-to-use README template for your profile. If you want a personalized version, tell me:
1. A one-line tagline or what you do.
2. 3–6 technologies you use most.
3. 2–4 projects to showcase (repo names or links).
4. Links for email, LinkedIn, Twitter, resume (if any).
5. Preferred theme for the GitHub stat cards (e.g., dark, light, tokyonight, radical).

Tell me those and I’ll update the README for you.
